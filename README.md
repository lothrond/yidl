# yidl
### youtube/invidious downloader
---
This is small bash wrapper for youtube-dl.\
This program supports android as well as a major upstream gnu/linux distribution (debian).
(For android users, this program assumes the termux terminal app).
---
(I only made this to make using youtube-dl easier for someone I know.\
Without the need for config files, etc. Common tasks can be done within one command line.
It currently serves as a simple wrapper-script.)
